Concepts related to users and their rights
------------------------------------------

In Phraseanet, if a user does not see a function or section, it is certainly
because he does not have the required access rights.
Also, it is not possible for a user to give more rights than he has himself when
he is validating a subscription or modifying rights.

.. note::

    A user who have no allocated rights is a ghost user.
    He is recognizable by a ghost icon in the users list.
