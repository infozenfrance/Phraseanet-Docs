    Relying on a :term:`HTML5` technology, the upload interface is accessible in
    Production via a a link located in title bar of the Phraseanet menu. Upload
    is an interface dedicated to adding media towards collections on which the
    user has adding rights.

.. note::

    For browsers that don't have the full HTML5 support, a display mode lying on
    the Adobe plug-in `FlashPlayer <http://get.adobe.com/fr/flashplayer/>`_ is 
    available.
