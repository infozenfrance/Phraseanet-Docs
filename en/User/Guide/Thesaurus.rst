    The Thesaurus is a documentary language management tool. In Phraseanet, its
    implementation is optional. It is used with the Phrasea engine and is not
    compatible with the Sphinx engine.

    In Production, the thesaurus serves :

    * **The contributors**, to give a reference vocabulary to describe the
      documentary resources of the base in the edition form.
    * **The users**, to browse the assets and make suggestions allowing to 
      narrow or expand the searches.

    The Thesaurus application is the interface dedicated to the thesaurus
    administration. Some maintenance actions are however possible in Production.


Comments on the thesaurus
-------------------------

A terminology management tool
*****************************

At its simplest, a thesaurus is a corpus of simple words or expressions reduced
to a sample knowledge domain, the one covered by the assets. It brings the
reference terms to precisely describe the documentary resources of the assets.

Artificial language, the concepts are represented by terms or expressions,
organized so the relations are explicit. The preferred terms used to describe
the resources come along with their synonyms or quasi-synonyms.

Relations in the Phraseanet thesaurus
*************************************

The Phraseanet thesaurus manages : 

* The relations between generic terms and specific terms
* The synonymy relations, in the same language or to other languages of the
  application.

This synonymy relation can be used to reflect the association between terms and
expressions of the thesaurus.

.. Warning::

    A thesaurus is a very powerful tool and its implementation can seem easy but
    can need Documentation knowledge depending on its final use and the expected
    results.

Activation of the thesaurus on a *Phraseanet* instance
******************************************************

The Phraseanet thesaurus is activated in the optional modules of the section
:ref:`Administration settings<Application-setting>`.

Set the radio button to *True* then submit the form to activate the thesaurus.

Access the thesaurus of a base
------------------------------

The Thesaurus application window is in two parts.

* The left part of the window displays the list of the **candidate terms**,
  terms and expressions from the documents indexation and the list of rejected
  or deleted terms that are displayed by the indexation field of the database.
* The right part displays the existing Thesaurus, as a tree that can be
  deployed. When putting the mouse cursor on a branch or a term, we display in
  rollover all the synonyms associated and the number of appearances in the
  database.
* To deploy a branch click on the "+" symbol. To close it, click on the "-"

Editing the thesaurus
---------------------

Add a term
**********

Adding a new specific term to a branch means that we add a lower lever term, it

* Type if needed a context
* Select a language for the term
* Click on **Validate**

A window opens if the term is not part of the candidates.

By default, the checkbox **Add the term without re-indexation** is checked.
Choose this option in most cases.

The choice **Add the term and re-index** will re-index the base and reset the
rejected terms.

* Click on Validate

.. note::
    The immediate re-indexation is not necessary if other terms are not yet
    added. The re-indexation can be launched after from **Phraseanet Admin**.

Link one or more branches of the thesaurus to a documentary field
*****************************************************************

This action allows to link one or more documentary fields of the base to a
branch of the thesaurus, to collect as candidate terms the vocabulary they

terms for the field.

    added, or that the indexation will be modified, will appear as candidate
    terms in a branch named after the field.

Work on the candidates
----------------------

The candidate terms are terms and expressions linked to branches of the
thesaurus but are not part of it. These terms can either come from information
extracted from the metadatas of a file that was added, or from the information
types from the Edit form of the records.

A part of the maintenance of the thesaurus consists in examining these
candidates. If they are relevant, they are destined to be integrated. On the
contrary, a correction of the notes can be necessary to use more appropriate
descriptors.

Adding candidate terms to the thesaurus is made either in Thesaurus or in
Production.

In Thesaurus

    fields they come from.
