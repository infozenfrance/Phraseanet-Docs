.. topic:: The essential

	A Phraseanet application is organized in bases and collections.
	Each of the	bases corresponds to a customizable documentary structure, the
	collections can be treated as base subsets.

.. Setting-Structure:
	
Customization per base
----------------------

Click on a base to display the status tab of a Phraseanet base.

.. image:: ../../images/Administration-base.jpg
    :align: center

This screen shows the indexation state of the base and allows the following
actions :

* Base re-indexation
* Collections creation in a base
* Logs deletion
* Records purge of a base
* Base deletion

Multi-base system, each base of a Phraseanet solution is finely customizable. To
do so, click on the **+** icon.

Setting the structure
*********************

This section displays the documentary structure of the selected base as a
writeable XML file.

.. image:: ../../images/Administration-structurexml.jpg
    :align: center

It's unlikely to have to customize a base using this interface, the interfaces
`Fields`_ , `Sub-definitions`_ or `Status settings`_ are more convenient to
use to change the settings.

Fields
******

The section **Fields** allows to define and edit the documentary structure of a 
Phraseanet base using forms in a graphical interface.

.. image:: ../../images/Administration-structurechamps.jpg
    :align: center

Each of these fields of the documentary structure is defined by customizable
properties :

* A unique name
* Text type, multivalued text or date
* Labels or localized labels depending on the interface languages
* A mandatory presence or not
* An optional data source
* An optional Dublin Core source
* An optional Business field property
* The order

.. note::

    **The field types are linked to the Phrasea engine**.
    :doc:`Refer to the fields type information of the FAQ <../../FAQ/Settings/Phrasea-field-types>`.

Sub-definition
**************

The section *Sub-Definition* allows to add and edit the media sub-definitions
for picture, videos, audio type integrated in Phraseanet.

.. image:: ../../images/Administration-sousdefinitions.jpg
    :align: center

The nature of the sub-definitions depends on the nature of the original
documents integrated in Phraseanet.
The table below lists some typical examples of sub-definitions created by the
application.

+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Nature of the original Media          | Nature of the sub-definition        |
+=======================================+============+==========+=============+
| Jpeg, psd, gif, png... pictures       | Jpeg sub-definition                 |
+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Mpeg, Avi, Mov... video               | Mpeg4 sub-definition or Jpeg        |
+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Wav, Mp3... audio                     | Mp3 sub-definition or Jpeg          |
+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Pdf, Word... office document          | Flash animation (Swf) of Jpeg       |
+---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

.. warning::

	The *thumbnail* and *preview* sub-definitions are essential.
	They are used in the Phraseanet interfaces to display the thumbnails and
	preview images of the media.

Statuses settings

The :term:`Statuses<Status>` allows to set states on documents and to restrict
the access to records to users regardless of the collection notions.

  the form.
