    The *Push* and the *Validation* are two actions intended to transmit 
	documents to users, whether they have Phraseanet accounts or not.

    The *Push* is used to push documents toward those users, the *Validation*,
	is intended to collect advisory opinion from the users about media.

    A `Lists manager`_ allows to create sending lists to answer some 
	repetitive sending towards the same users.

Push
----

The Push is a submission of documents in :doc:`Phraseanet Lightbox<Lightbox>`.
Reversely to the e-mail sending proposed by the export features, the*Push*
does not transmit the documents physically.
It notifies in the *Production* interface, and also notifies by e-mail, and 
leave at the users disposal some media selections coming from baskets that they 
can consult and eventually download.
