Add a base
==========

.. topic:: The essential

	After the installation, a Phraseanet base is available in the application
	in order to receive media. However, for some reason, it might be necessary
	to create an other. Oh to create a new Phraseanet base ?

Create a new database in the database manager
---------------------------------------------

This first step is done outside Phraseanet.

* Ask the system administrator to create a new base in the database manager
  (MariaDB / MySQL).

.. seealso::

    `See the MySQL documentation`_

.. note::

	This database can be created on the same database server of the	Application
	box (the applicative base of Phraseanet) or in an other database server.

.. warning::

	In these two cases, ask that the Phraseanet application can access the
	database with sufficient rights level, depending on the deployment context.

* Fetch the name of the created database, and if the database is created in
  a different server than the Application box, also fetch the connection
  settings.
* Connect to Phraseanet Admin as an Administrator.

Create the Phraseanet base
--------------------------

In Admin, click on the *Base* section.

* Fill the **Create a base** form

  **If the created database is on the same server than the Application box**,
  enter the name of the base then choose one of the documentary structure in the
  drop-down menu *XML structure template*.

  **If the created database in on an other server than the Application box**,
  check the  *Create a base on an other server* box then fill the connection
  settings of the database server.

  * **Hostname**
  * **Port** (3306 by default)
  * **Username of the MySQL database**
  * **User password of the MySQL database**
  * **The name of the create database**

  Choose one of the suggested documentary structures in the drop-down menu
  *XML structure template*.

* Send the form

The script automates the creation of the required tables in the database
manager.

After this creation process, the structure of the database can be set.

	Refer to the Phraseanet base setting<Setting-Structure>` section.

Depending on the needs and to publish a new Phraseanet base, it is required to
create at least one collection.
