Mass users insert
=================

In some cases, it is not thinkable to sign up dozens or hundreds of users, one
by one using the standard account creation process.

In this case, the simplest process is a mass user import.

* Go in **Admin** then in the section **Users**
* Click on the **Import** link

The displayed interface gives examples of CSV files and a user guide.

Prepare the CSV file as explained in the example, then import it using the form.

The importation of users have been successfully tested with a file containing
10 000 users.

.. note::
	
	The import process is capable of detecting IDs duplication, so that this
	creation method can be used regularly.
